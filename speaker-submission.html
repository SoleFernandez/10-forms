            <!-- The action attribute defines the URL that processes the form. It’s where the input collected by the form is sent when the user clicks the Submit button. This is typically a special URL defined by your web server that knows how to process the data. -->

            <!-- The method attribute can be either post or get, both of which define how the form is submitted to the backend server. This is largely dependent on how your web server wants to handle the form, but the general rule of thumb is to use post when you’re changing data on the server, reserving get for when you’re only getting data. -->

            <!-- By leaving the action attribute blank, we’re telling the form to submit to the same URL. Combined with the get method, this will let us inspect the contents of the form. -->
            
            <div class="form-row">
                <label for="full-name">Name</label>
                <input id="full-name" name="full-name" type="text">

                <!-- First, we have a container <div> to help with styling. This is pretty common for separating input elements. Second, we have a <label>, which you can think of as another semantic HTML element, like <article> or <figcaption>, but for form labels. A label’s for attribute must match the id attribute of its associated <input/> element. Third, the <input/> element creates a text field. It can dramatically change appearance depending on its type attribute, but it always creates some kind of interactive user input.
                
                Remember that ID selectors are bad—the id attribute here is only for connecting it to a <label> element.
                    
                Conceptually, an <input/> element represents a “variable” that gets sent to the backend server. The name attribute defines the name of this variable, and the value is whatever the user entered into the text field. Note that you can pre-populate this value by adding a value attribute to an <input/> element.-->

                <!-- Unlike text fields, the user can’t enter custom values into a radio button, which is why each one of them needs an explicit value attribute. This is the value that will get sent to the server when the user submits the form. It’s also very important that each radio button has the same name attribute, otherwise the form wouldn’t know they were part of the same group. -->

                <!-- Just like our radio button <input/> elements, we have name and value attributes that get passed to the backend server. But, instead of being defined on a single element, they’re spread across the <select> and <option> elements. -->

                    <!-- The way we used <label> here was a little different than previous sections. Instead of being a separate element, the <label> wraps its corresponding <input/> element. This is perfectly legal, and it’ll make it easier to match our desired layout. It’s still a best practice to use the for attribute. -->
                    <input type="checkbox"
                            id="available"

                            value="is-available" />
                    <span>I'm actually available the date of the talk</span>
                </label>
            </div>

            <div class="form-row">
                <button>Submit</button>
                <!-- licking the button tells the browser to validate all of the <input/> elements in the form and submit it to the action URL if there aren’t any validation problems. -->
            </div>

            <!-- This also gives us a chance to see how the user’s input gets sent to the server. 
            You should see something like this: 
        speaker-submission.html?full-name=Rick&email=rick%40internetingishard.com&talk-type=workshop&t-shirt=l&abstract=Derp.&available=is-available
    
    Everything after the ? represents the variables in our form. Each <input/>’s name attribute is followed by an equal sign, then its value, and each variable is separated by an & character. If we had a backend server, it’d be pretty easy for it to pull out all this information, query a database (or whatever), and let us know whether the form submission was successful or not.-->

        </form>

        <!-- Generally speaking, there are two ways to process forms:

Use the action attribute to send the form data to a backend URL, which then redirects to a success or error page. We got a little glimpse of this in the previous section, and it doesn’t require any JavaScript.
Use AJAX queries to submit the form without leaving the page. Success or error messages are displayed on the same page by manipulating the HTML with JavaScript.
Depending on how your organization is structured, form processing may not be part of your job role as a frontend web developer. If that’s the case, you’ll need to coordinate closely with a backend developer on your team to make sure the <form> submits the correct name-value pairs. Otherwise, it’ll be up to you to make sure the frontend and backend of your forms fit neatly together. -->
